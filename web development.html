    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>
        Web development is the process of creating,
         building, and maintaining websites or web 
         applications. It involves everything from
          designing how the website looks and 
          functions to making sure it works properly 
          and is accessible to users. Web development can encompass a wide range of tasks, and it is typically divided into front-end (client-side) development and back-end (server-side) development. A full-fledged web application may require both of these areas, along 
        with database management, API integrations, and deployment.
